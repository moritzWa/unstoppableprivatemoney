- We use Tailwind CSS and Shadcn components. You can find them in client/src/components/ui/. Before adding a new component first check if it already exist. If not you can install it using this pattern `npx shadcn@latest add {componentName}`. Do not generate components from scratch that exist as part of the Shadcn library!
